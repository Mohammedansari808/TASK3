-> Window is the main JavaScript object root, and it is the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the
     root of the document object model. 
 ->Window has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been 
    closed, its parents, and more.
-> The window contains everything, so you can call window.screen and window.document to get those elements


SCREEN IN JAVASCRIPT
->window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
->The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:
->screen properties width and height are the full screen.
->screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar.
->The portion of a screen displaying the rendered document is the viewport in JavaScript, 
 ->The getBoundingClientRect() method of any document element will return an object with
 ->top, left, bottom, and right properties describing the location of the element in the viewport.

DOCUMENT IN JAVASCRIPT
->window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible document
   object model or DOM.
->The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available
    to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
->Since window is the global object, you can reference any properties of it with just the property name . 
    so we do not have to write down window.
FOR EXAMPLE :
    document. == window.document both are same
